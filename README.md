# printPQ

This is pet project that I am working on to learn Go. My process and research will go below and will later be consolidated into articles on [my site](shariqnaiyer.com).

### Setup

1. I setup the project folder, I choose the name PrintPQ (Print Priority Queue) taking inspiration from RabbitMQ (Rabbit Message Queue).
2. Most Go projects have a cmd and an internal folder with cmd containing the main.go entrypoint.

Programs start running in package main.

```go main.go
package main

func main() {

}
```

One of the first things we would like to setup is a web framework to create an HTTP server. I will likely have an HTTP client in Go as well.

### Web Framework

There's quite a lot of Go backend frameworks to choose from.

The most popular one seems to be [Gin](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin) with 83k Github Stars.
